    <p id="line1"></p>
    <p id="line2">Round like a cicle in a spiral,</p>
    <p id="line3">like a wheel within a wheel</p>
    <p id="line4">Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel</p>
    <p id="line5">Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon</p>
    <p id="line6">Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon</p>
    <p id="line7">And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space</p>
    <p id="line8">Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind</p>
    <p id="line9">Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own</p>
    <p id="line10">Down a hallow to a cavern where the sun has never shone</p>
    <p id="line11">Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgetten dream</p>
    <p id="line12">Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream</p>
    <p id="line13">Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face</p>
    <p id="line14">And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space</p>
    <p id="line15">Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind</p>
    <p id="line16">Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head</p>
    <p id="line17">Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?</p>
    <p id="line18">Lovers walka along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand</p>
