  <div id="speech">
    <p id="line1"></p>
    <p id="line2">Round like a circle in a spiral,</p>
    <p id="line3">like a wheel within a wheel</p>
    <p id="line4">Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel </p>
    <p id="line5">Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon</p>
    <p id="line6">Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon</p>
    <p id="line7">Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face</p>
    <p id="line8">And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space</p>
    <p id="line9">Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind</p>
    <p id="line10">Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own</p>
    <p id="line11">Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone</p>
    <p id="line12">Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream</p>
    <p id="line13">Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream</p>
    <p id="line14">Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face</p>
    <p id="line15">And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space</p>
    <p id="line16">Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind</p>
    <p id="line17">Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head</p>
    <p id="line18">Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?</p>
    <p id="line19">Lovers walk along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand</p>
    <p id="line20">Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?</p>
    <p id="line21">Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song</p>
    <p id="line22">Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?</p>
    <p id="line23">When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware</p>
    <p id="line24">That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!</p>
    <p id="line25">Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel</p>
    <p id="line26">Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel</p>
    <p id="line27">As the images unwind, like the circles that you find</p>
    <p id="line28">In the windmills of your mind!</p>
