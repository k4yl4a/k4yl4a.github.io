  <h3>My clothing style is something personal to me, it tells me who I am and what I value. It's a 
      reflection of me in ways I wouldn't typically consider. For some background, once I hit puberty 
    and became more involved on social media, I wanted to buy a lot of new and different clothes. It 
  was like I was Eve after eating the apple realizing she was naked. But I was 13 and had no job so 
my main hobby became thrifting clothes. And it was such a high finding good cute clothing for 
'cheap' at GoodWill, Salvation Army, Plato's closet, garage sales, Crossroads, etc. A large 
percentage of my clothing is second-hand, which is important to me because I am well aware of
the fashion industry's environmental impacts and don't want to further contribute to the harm.</h3>
